'''This project collects customer information by keeping names
and email addresses in a dictionary as key-value pairs.
It displays a menu that lets the user look up a personâ€™s email address,
add a new name and email address, change an existing email address,
and delete an existing name and email address.
The program saves the data stored in a dictionary
to a file when the user exits the program.
Each time the program starts,
it retrieves the data from the file and stores it in a dictionary.
